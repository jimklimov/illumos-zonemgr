# Common configuration for self-tests

# Note that OpenIndiana/hipster default "ipkg" zones are linked
# (so NGZ has same package versions as GZ), and a "nlipkg" can
# be used for independent local zones. OmniOS on the opposite
# has non-linked zones as "ipkg" and can use "lipkg" for linked.
# It is suggested to test with non-linked zones, to reduce the
# maintenance overhead when updating the host OS. It may also
# be useful in production, so work environments do not suddenly
# change as you update your hosting system. Then again, YMMV.
